# Neovim configs

## Origin
Config is derived from ThePrimeagen's 0 - LSP Neovim setup  
Changes include the LSP part of the video as Mason updated to a new paradigm, so I had to manually figure out how to do it.  
Another change is the custom keybindings, I did not include everything, only the useful ones as I want to learn Vim the way it is first before changing the keybinds.

## Suggestions
- Issues and PRs are welcome :)
    - Issue for things that I may figure out myself
    - PRs for things that I cannot figure out on my own. (5 days of learning rn)

## How to use

### Windows
1. Go to `AppData/Local`
2. Clone this repository there.
3. It should create a `nvim` folder in the Local folder.

### Linux
1. Go to `~/.config` folder.
2. Clone this repository there.
3. It should create a `nvim` folder in the config folder.
