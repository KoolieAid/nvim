# Neovim configs

## Origin
Config is derived from ThePrimeagen's 0 - LSP Neovim setup  
Changes include the LSP part of the video as Mason updated to a new paradigm, so I had to manually figure out how to do it.  
Another change is the custom keybindings, I did not include everything, only the useful ones as I want to learn Vim the way it is first before changing the keybinds.
